# My_Deep-Learning_Journey
updating my stage by stage learning in DL concepts.

</br>

<pre>
Day 01(22nd june)- starting with the basics of python and fundamendal mathematics
Day 02(23rd june)- understanding the foundations of Machine learning basic machine learning concepts.
Day 03(24th june)- different steps and practices in machine learning
                    <i>loading a data-Exploratory data analysis-Preprocessing-Model selection-training and evaluation</i>
Day 04(25th june)- applying various models and practical implementation using scikit-learn
Day 05(26th june)- Deep learning basics with Neural Networks and getting started with <b><i>PyTorch</i></b>
Day 06(27th june)- understanding what are activation function and loss function, their types and case specific usage
Day 07(28th june)- learning different optimization functions
Day 08(29th june)- going deeper into FNN
                    -trying multiple hidden layer structures
                    -template for using a custom dataset
                    -hyper parameter tuning for RNN's  
Day 09(30th june)- starting with CNN (why to use cnn over FNN and it's key terms)
